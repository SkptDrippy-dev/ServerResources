-- This is a heavily modified & highly simplified version of nearest postal from @DevBlocky: https://github.com/DevBlocky/nearest-postal
-- just for the purposes of displaying it in the HUD, as the exports for getting distance to nearest postal wasn't available.
-- This IS NOT designed to be a replacement for nearest-postal, as it does not include commands for waypoints etc. I recommend still
-- using nearest-postal alongside JG HUD!
